# sentimentAnalysis-BERT

This is a sentiment analysis project developed using BERT model. It can be used to analyze sentiments through texts, I have used the reviews on Yelp for this project and can also be used for other websites (for educational purposes only).

Steps:
- Installing and importing the required dependancies
- Loading the model and passing a test scenario 
- Scraping the webiste to fetch the reviews
- Generating a sentiment score on a scale of 1 to 5 for those reviews

Cheers! Happy Coding :)
